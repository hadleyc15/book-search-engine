This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# <div align="center">**Book Search Engine**</div>

## **Project Description**
> This week, you’ll take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
